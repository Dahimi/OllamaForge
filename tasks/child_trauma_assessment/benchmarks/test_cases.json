      "expected_output": "Based on the information provided, your daughter is showing several common signs of trauma response, including sleep disturbances, heightened anxiety, and behavioral changes. These reactions are normal given the circumstances, but they do warrant attention and support.\n\nKey Observations:\n- Sleep disruption with nightmares\n- Increased attachment behavior (clinginess)\n- Heightened startle response to loud noises\n- Significant changes in daily activities\n\nImmediate Recommendations:\n1. Maintain consistent bedtime routines to help with sleep\n2. Provide reassurance and physical presence when she's anxious\n3. Create safe opportunities for play within the shelter\n4. Consider simple relaxation techniques appropriate for her age\n\nPlease note: While these symptoms are concerning, they are common reactions to trauma in children. However, given the intensity of her symptoms, I strongly recommend seeking professional support when possible. Would you like information about available mental health resources in your area?"
